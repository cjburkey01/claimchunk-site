# Configuration

Configuration for ClaimChunk is spit up into a couple separate places.

For global ClaimChunk configurations, the [`config.yml` page](./MainConfigFile.md) explains what can be configured.

If you need some users to have a different maximum claim limit than others, check out the [rank config page](./RanksConfig.md) to see how to implement this.
